# Ansible
[![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/ffsh/ansible/actions/workflows/ansible-lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ffsh/ansible/actions/workflows/ansible-lint.yml)

This repository holds the Ansible playbook to deploy a ffsh gateway in the standard configuration.
It is based on https://docs.freifunk-suedholstein.de/de/1.5/gateway.html but changes were made where it was plausible.

## requirements
- Clone the repository.
- Ansible [installed](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#selecting-an-ansible-package-and-version-to-install)

## ssh-key
As the login is done via ssh make sure that the ssh key is registered at your identity manager `ssh-add $keyfile`.
That way Ansible will be able to automatically detect the right ssh key and connect to the server.

## hosts
If you want to deploy to a new gateway you need to add it to the `hosts` file in the repo, just compare it to brunsbach and add your own details.

### host_vars/$gatewayname.yml
You also need to supply your fastd secret as an encrypted secret, you get the password via the NOC Team.

To create a new fastd secret, execute the following, this will ask you for a password and open an editor.
```
ansible-vault create --vault-id fastd_key@prompt host_vars/$gatewayname.yml
```

The config has the following options.

| option       | comment                                                                      |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fastd_secret | fastd secret key                                                             |
| wg_device    | Optional but you can put the name here that was generated by mullvad         |
| wg_pk        | Wireguard private key provided by mullvad                                    |
| wg_address   | ipV4 and ipV6 address provided by mullvad                                    |
| wg_country   | Country supported by mullvad                                                 |
| wg_city      | A City that mullvad has in your selected country                             |
| ffshmon_mail | The email that should be used to send alerts if the wireguard tunnel is down |
| ffshmon_pw   | The password for the email                                                   |

For available country and city check here: https://mullvad.net/de/servers

Example config:

```
fastd_secret: 1234df132fssd...
wg_device: Mellow Pony
wg_pk: aDfkfdsgnn1232345...
wg_address: 1.2.3.4/32,fxx...../128
wg_country: Netherlands
wg_city: Amsterdam
ffshmon_mail: wg-mon@freifunk-suedholstein.de
ffshmon_pw: secretpassword
```
save and close the editor, done you added your secret :)

You can change the content any time by
```
ansible-vault edit --vault-id fastd_key@prompt host_vars/$gatewayname.yml
```
## Usage

Run playbook on all gateways listed in `hosts`:

```
ansible-playbook --vault-id=fastd_key@prompt setup.yml
```

Run playbook on one host
```
ansible-playbook --vault-id=fastd_key@prompt setup.yml --limit $hostname
```

Run only the roles with the specific tag, to see which role is attached to which tag open `setup.yaml`:

```
ansible-playbook --vault-id=fastd_key@prompt setup.yml --tags "ssh keys"
```

These can also be combined:

```
ansible-playbook --vault-id=fastd_key@prompt setup.yml --limit $hostname --tags "oh-my-zsh"
```
